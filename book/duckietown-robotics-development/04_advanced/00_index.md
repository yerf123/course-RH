Excerpt: Learn about ROS and how to use it within Duckietown, creating and processing logs, and programming simple robot behaviour.

In this section, you will learn how to use the Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable different processes running on your Duckiebot to communicate with each other. You will also learn how to monitor/visualize these communications, change the behaviour of your robot on-the-fly, and work with ROS logs.
