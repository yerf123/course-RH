# Working with SD Cards {#sdcards status=ready}

Excerpt: Everything you need to work with SD cards.

## Testing SD Card and disk speed {#test-sd-card-speed}

Test SD Card (or any disk) speed using the following commands,
which write to a file called `![filename]`.

    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=![filename] bs=500K count=1024
    $ sync
    $ echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    $ dd if=![filename] of=/dev/null bs=500K count=1024
    $ rm ![filename]

Note the `sync` and the `echo` command are very important.

Example results:

    524288000 bytes (524 MB, 500 MiB) copied, 30.2087 s, 17.4 MB/s
    524288000 bytes (524 MB, 500 MiB) copied, 23.3568 s, 22.4 MB/s

That is write 17.4 MB/s, read 22 MB/s.


## How to burn an image to an SD card {#howto-burn-image}

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: A blank SD card.

Requires: An image file to burn.

Requires: An Ubuntu computer with an SD reader.

Results: A burned image.

</div>

### Finding your device name for the SD card

First, find out what is the device name for the SD card.

Insert the SD Card in the slot.

Run the command:

    $ sudo fdisk -l

Find your device name, by looking at the sizes.

For example, the output might contain:

    Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 14.9 GiB, 15931539456 bytes, 31116288 sectors
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

In this case, the device is `/dev/mmcblk0`. That will be the `![device]`
in the next commands.

You may see `/dev/mmcblk0pX` or a couple of similar entries for each partition on the card,
where `X` is the partition number. If you don't see anything like that, take out
the SD card and run the command again and see what disappeared.

### Unmount partitions

Before proceeding, unmount all partitions.

Warning: Before unmounting partitions, make sure you found the correct device in the previous
step. In particular, `/dev/sda/` is the hard drive of your computer, and if you unmount its partitions,
you can erase important data, including important files and the operating system you are not currently
using.

Run `df -h`. If there are partitions like `/dev/mmcblk0p![n]`, then unmount
each of them. For example:

    laptop $ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
    laptop $ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2


### Burn the image

Now that you know that the device is `![device]`,
you can burn the image to disk.

Let the image file be `![image file]`.

Burn the image using the command `dd`:

    laptop $ sudo dd of=![device] if=![image file] status=progress bs=4M

Note: Use the name of the device, without partitions. i.e., `/dev/mmcblk0`, not
`/dev/mmcblk0pX`.

Note: dd comand with status=progress parameter only work for dd --version 8.24 ubuntu16.04.2

## How to shrink an image {#howto-shrink-image}

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: An image file to burn.

Requires: An Ubuntu computer.

Results: A shrunk image.

</div>

We are going to use the tool `gparted` so make sure it's installed

    laptop $ sudo apt install gparted

Let the image file be `![image file]` and its name be `![imagename]`.
Run the command:

    laptop $ sudo fdisk -l ![image file]

It should give you something like:
```
Device                       Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
duckiebot-RPI3-LP-aug15.img1        2048   131071   129024   63M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
duckiebot-RPI3-LP-aug15.img2      131072 21219327 21088256 10.1G 83 Linux
```
Take note of the start of the Linux partition (in our case 131072), let's call it `![start]`.
Now we are going to mount the Linux partition from the image:

    laptop $ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 ![imagename].img -o $((![start]*512))

and then run `gparted`:

    laptop $ sudo gparted /dev/loop0

In `gparted` click on the partition and click "Resize" under the "Partition" menu. Resize drag the arrow or enter a size
that is equal to the minimum size plus 20MB

Note: This didn't work well for me - I had to add much more than 20MB for it to work.

Click the "Apply" check mark. *Before* closing the final screen click through the arrows in the dialogue box
to find a line such a "`resize2fs -p /dev/loop0 1410048K`". Take note of the new size of your partition. Let's
call it `![new size]`.

Now remove the loopback on the second partition and setup a loopback on the whole image and run `fdisk`:

    laptop $ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
    laptop $ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 ![image file]
    laptop $ sudo fdisk /dev/loop0

    Command (m for help): ![enter d]
    Partition number (1,2, default 2): ![enter 2]
    Command (m for help): ![enter n]
    Partition type
    p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)
    e   extended (container for logical partitions)
    Select (default p): ![enter p]
    Partition number (2-4, default 2): ![enter 2]
    First sector (131072-62521343, default 131072): ![start]
    Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (131072-62521343, default 62521343): +![new size]K

Note: on the last line include the `+` and the `K` as part of the size.

    Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 10.1 GiB.

    Command (m for help): ![enter w]
    The partition table has been altered.
    Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
    Re-reading the partition table failed.: Invalid argument

    The kernel still uses the old table. The new table will be used at the next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8).

Disregard the final error.

You partition has now been resized and the partition table has been updated. Now we will remove the loopback and then
truncate the end of the image file:

    laptop $ fdisk -l /dev/loop0

```
Device       Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/loop0p1        2048   131071   129024   63M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/loop0p2      131072 21219327 21088256 10.1G 83 Linux
```
Note down the end of the second partition (in this case 21219327). Call this `![end]`.

    laptop $ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
    laptop $ sudo truncate -s $(((![end]+1)*512)) ![image file]

You now have a shrunken image file.

It might be useful to compress it, before distribution:

    laptop $ xz ![image file]
