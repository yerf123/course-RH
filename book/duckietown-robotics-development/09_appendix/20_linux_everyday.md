## `man` {#man}

This is an interface to the on-line reference manuals. Whenever you meet some unfamiliar commands, try use `man certain_command` before Googling. You will find it extremely clear, useful and self-contained.

## `cd` {#cd}

Go to the directory you want. If you just use:

    $ cd

then you will go to your home directory, i.e., /home/user/

To go up one directory use:

    $ cd ..

## `sudo` {#sudo}

Whenever you want to modify system files, you will need `sudo`. Commonly touched system files including `/etc`, `/opt` and so on. Since most of you have followed the guideline to use passwordless sudo, I would recommend that make sure what you are doing with sudo before you execute the command, otherwise you may need to reinstall the system.

## `ls` {#ls}

List all the files and documents in the current directory. From `~/.bashrc`, we know some commonly used alias. See more by `man ls`.

-- `la` for `ls -a` which will list out all files and documents including the hidden ones(whose name starts with a dot).

-- `ll` for `ls -l` which will display Unix file types, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, last-modified date and filename.

## `cp` {#cp}

`cp fileA directoryB` will copy the file A to directory B. See more by executing `man cp`.

## `mv` {#mv}

This command can be used to rename a file, to do so execute:
`mv fileA fileB`

## `mkdir` {#mkdir}

Make new directory. See more by `man mkdir`.

## `touch` {#touch}

Update the access and modification times of the input file to current time. See more by `man touch`.
It can be used to create empty documents, for example:
`touch duckie.txt` Will create an empty text file.

## `reboot` {#reboot}

This command must be executed as root. `sudo` required. This will reboot your laptop or Raspberry Pi. See more by `man reboot`.

## `shutdown` {#shutdown}

This command requires `sudo`. You can set a countdown to shutdown you machine. More by `man shutdown`.

# Mounting USB drives {#mounting-usb status=ready}

First **plug in the USB drive** nothing will work if you don't do that first. Now ssh into your robot. On the command line type:

    duckiebot $ lsusb

you should see your Sandisk USB drive as an entry. Congrats, you correctly plugged it in

    duckiebot $ lsblk

Under name you should see `sda1`, with size about 28.7GB and nothing under the `MOUNTPOINT` column (if you see something under `MOUNTPOINT` congrats you are done.

If it is not there already, make the directory to mount to:

    duckiebot $ sudo mkdir /data/logs

Next mount the drive

    duckiebot $ sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /data/logs -o umask=000

Test by running `lsblk` again and you should now see `/data/logs` under `MOUNTPOINT`

## Unmounting a USB drive {#unmount-usb}

    duckiebot $ sudo umount /data/logs
