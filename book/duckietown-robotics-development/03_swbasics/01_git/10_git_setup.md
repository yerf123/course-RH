## Git setup {#git-setup status=ready}

### Installation

The basic Git program is installed using

    $ sudo apt install git

Additional utilities for `git` are installed using:

    $ sudo apt install git-extras

This include the `git-ignore` utility, which comes in handy when you have files that you don't actually want to have pushed to the remote branch (such as temporary files).


### Setting up global configurations for Git  {#howto-git-local-config}

This should be done twice, once on the laptop, and later, on the robot.

These options tell Git who you are:

    $ git config --global user.email "![email]"
    $ git config --global user.name  "![full name]"

Also do this, and it doesn't matter if you don't know what it is:

    $ git config --global push.default simple
