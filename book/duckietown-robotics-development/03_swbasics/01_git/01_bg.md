You should read a [good book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) about Git.

We suggest you work through the [Github guides](https://guides.github.com/), such as:

- [Github bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/)
- [Github handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Github tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/Llow/)

For the more advanced topics:

- [Github branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
- [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

And you should know nobody remembers all Git commands:
